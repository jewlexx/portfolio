I am an independent software developer, who works mostly on the backend, but I also dabble in frontends, for [desktop](https://github.com/jewlexx/fauxchat), [web](/), mobile, and [CLI](https://github.com/winpax/sfsu).

I also have a couple of open-source Rust libraries, including [discord-presence](https://github.com/jewlexx/discord-presence), [sprinkles](https://github.com/winpax/sprinkles) and [quork](https://github.com/jewlexx/quork).

I have a range of abilities, including:

- Web development
- Rust
- C++
- C#
- Java
- Python
- TypeScript
- Astro
- Svelte
- SolidJS
- Scoop

I am also a big fan of [open source](https://github.com/jewlexx), and I love to help people out with their projects.

If you want to get in touch, you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jewelexx), [GitHub](https://github.com/jewlexx), or shoot me an email at [hello@maybejules.com](mailto:hello@maybejules.com).
