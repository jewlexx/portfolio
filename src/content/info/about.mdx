## Who am I?

I am an independent software developer, who works mostly on the backend, but I also dabble in frontends, for [CLI](https://github.com/winpax/sfsu), [desktop](https://github.com/jewlexx/fauxchat), [web](/), and mobile.

I also have a couple of open-source Rust libraries, including [discord-presence](https://github.com/jewlexx/discord-presence), [sprinkles](https://github.com/winpax/sprinkles) and [quork](https://github.com/jewlexx/quork).

I have a range of experience, working with a variety of technologies, including:

- Rust
- C#
- Java
- TypeScript
- Various web frameworks including
  - React & NextJS (like this website ðŸ˜±)
  - Astro
  - Svelte
  - SolidJS
- Scripting and automation using
  - Bash
  - PowerShell
  - Python

I am also a big fan of [open source](https://github.com/jewlexx), and I love to help people out with their projects.

If you want to get in touch, you can find me on [Twitter (X)](https://x.com/jewelexx), [GitHub](https://github.com/jewlexx), or shoot me an email at [me@cordor.dev](mailto:me@cordor.dev).
