Super **⚡ fast ⚡** replacements and additions to [Scoop](https://scoop.sh) commands written in the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

It can override the existing [Scoop](https://scoop.sh) install for all commands that it has, using the [hooks](https://github.com/jewlexx/sfsu#hook).

More in depth benchmarking information can be found in the [benchmarking section of the README](https://github.com/jewlexx/sfsu#benchmarks-1), but to summarize, it is multiple [orders of magnitude](https://g.co/kgs/KqoK2G) faster than default [Scoop](https://scoop.sh).
