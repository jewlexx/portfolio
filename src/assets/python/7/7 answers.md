# Task 1

The following is the result from the code I wrote in the `getting started.py` file, followed by the file itself:

`7.1 getting started.py`

# Task 2

This was the second task.

I had an issue here with the way I am compiling the python source at build time, as it does not support `stdin` and `stdout` as arguments.

Because of this I had to hardcode the responses, but lets just pretend that I didn't do that, and you typed in your responses

`7.2 names.py`
